description: ""
summary: "Bayesian approaches explicitly account for the uncertainty present in most machine learning problems. This uncertainty derives from both randomness in observational processes and incompleteness in problem understanding. This course focused on
building models from data that provide predictions and quantify the uncertainty in these predictions."
