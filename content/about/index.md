I am a software engineer and Data Science master's student at the University of Virginia, with a background in industrial automation and dual degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

I am mostly interested in AI research and development in areas such as signal processing, AI-powered creativity technologies, and systems optimization, including compiler design and programming abstractions for AI workloads.
