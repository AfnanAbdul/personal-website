description: "A deep learning-based approach to classifying human emotions from speech audio recordings using convolutional and recurrent neural networks."
summary: "As part of my **Deep Learning** course, this project explores the use of convolutional and recurrent neural networks for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). Using the RAVDESS and TESS datasets, we train models to classify emotions from audio signals, aiming to improve human-computer interaction, mental health applications, and AI-driven affective computing."
