description: "A research project exploring methods for detecting AI-generated text, benchmarking existing detection models, and developing a robust classifier to distinguish human-written and LLM-generated content."
summary: "As part of my **Decoding LLMs** course, this project investigates the challenges of detecting AI-generated text in academic settings. Our team explores state-of-the-art detection methods, benchmarks existing classifiers, and develops a detection model trained on diverse datasets. The goal is to enhance academic integrity by providing reliable AI-text detection tools."
